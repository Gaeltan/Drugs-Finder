# Drugs-Finder
It helps to see the benefits and weeknesses of drugs by searching their names

ðŸ©º Project Description
This project aims to list a limited number of medicines (currently 50) stored in a database file named MEDICAMENTS.xlsx.
This Excel file interacts with a Python program called app.py, which uses Flask and Pandas:

Flask connects the database to a web interface (HTML and CSS), allowing you to interact with the data via your browser.

Pandas reads the Excel file in Python, making it easy to filter and extract medicine information.

The Python program checks whether a medicine exists in the database.
If it does, it displays its benefits and side effects.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
Open PowerShell (or your terminal) and run:

python app.py

Open your web browser and go to:
